# Python Best Practises

Here we define the standards and best practices we follow when developing Python projects.

## 1. Repository Layout - Top-Level Directories

## 2. Style

Source: [PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

## 3. Quality Ensurance Tools

### a) Formatter

- [black - uncompromising Python code formatter](https://github.com/psf/black)
- [docformatter - formats docstrings to follow PEP 257](https://github.com/PyCQA/docformatter)

### b) Static Code Analyser

- [Bandit - a tool designed to find common security issues in Python code](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit)
- [Flake8 - a python tool that glues together pycodestyle, pyflakes, mccabe, and third-party plugins to check the style and quality of some python code](https://github.com/pycqa/flake8)
  - includes: [mccabe - complexity checker for Python](https://github.com/PyCQA/mccabe)
  - includes: [pycodestyle - a simple Python style checker in one Python file](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle)
  - includes: [pyflakes - a simple program which checks Python source files for errors](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes)
  - includes: [radon - various code metrics for Python code](https://github.com/rubik/radon)
