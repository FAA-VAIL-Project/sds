Here are all the standards and best practices to be followed in software development for the FAA-VAIL project.
Furthermore, for each of the programming languages selected for the project, there is an implentation example to demonstrate the defined rules.
All programming languages implement a polynomial multiplication based on a Fast Fourier Transformation for this purpose.  
Explanations of the task and the detailed specification of the requirements can be found in [Polynomial Multiplication](polynomial_multiplication.md).
