# sds - File Directory **`.github/workflows`**

This directory contains the following GitHub Action workflow:

- `documentation.yml` - creates the static HTML pages with the documentation using MkDocs and then updates the `site` file directory in the repository.
- `python.yml` - perform all Python development-specific tools, including formatting, static code analysis, style enforcement, documentation creation and run all tests based on pytest.
